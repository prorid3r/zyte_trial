# Put your assumptions here
1. First dimension is height second is width
2. First type of dimension is taken (if many are present, like "image", "mount" etc...)
3. Decided to clean up authors occupation from their names. If it was needed I would probably separate those fields
4. Not sure whether the "untitled" titles should be stripped of this word or not. For example "Untitled [red branch in snow]"
